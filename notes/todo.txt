Known bugs/tasks:

- Missile Torizo AI fixes and patterns
	Currently spawns in the wrong room position, which really needs fixing. I also want to add some Missile-related attacks and generally re-design the fight a bit. Also remove the haze effect.

- Backwards SECURITY GATE cutscene

- Kraid
	Need to copy whatever's necessary from vanilla for it to work. Then I want to write some ASM to wait until you're close to the left side of the screen before he rises up from the floor. Also it's going to be a different battle arena so I'll need to update the AI too lol

- Kraid boss door
	Currently set to the generic "boss from area defeated", but I probably want to make that Kraid-specific since Draygon is in the same area. (At least right now)
