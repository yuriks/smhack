Darkness PLM
Version 1.0
By: Benox50

Make bottom of room goes dark, more versatile than vanilla haze, brightness instead of backdrop color, so can use with FXs

PLM settings, XX YZ :
; Height of PLM in room define when it starts to darken
; XX = Darkness bands size
; Y = Parallax divisor (0 to make it follows the camera)
; Z = How much darkness bands (cant more than F anyway)
